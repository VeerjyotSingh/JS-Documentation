         Introduction
       </h1>
       <p>
        JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
        It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (
        for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the 
        objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over 
        them.
        <br><br>
        JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
        Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators,
        control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended 
        for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects;
        for example:
       </p>
       <ul>
       <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying 
         objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
          For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place 
          elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse 
          clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
          <br>
          <li>
            Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying 
            objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,
             server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with 
             a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation
              to another of the application, or perform file manipulations 
              on a server.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h1 id="what">
          What you should already know
        </h1>
        <p>
          This guide assumes you have the following basic background:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
            Some programming experience. If you are new to programming,
             try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h1 id="java">
          JavaScript and Java
        </h1>
        <p>
          JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different 
          in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have
           Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most 
           Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow 
           constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to 
           JavaScript.
           <br>
           <br>
           In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by 
           declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a 
           small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and 
           string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model 
           instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype
           -based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited
            can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports 
            functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions
             can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
             <br>
             <br>
             JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do 
             not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do 
             not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private,
              or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables
              , parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.
            </p>
            <h1 id="hello">
              Hello World
            </h1>
            <p>
              To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and
               write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
            </p>
            <div>
              <p>
              function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
              <br><br>
              greetMe("World");</p>
            </div>
            <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold 
              in your browser!</p>
            <h1 id="var">
              Variables
            </h1>
            <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application.
               The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
               <br><br>
               A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), 
               or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9).
               Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters
               "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" 
               (lowercase).
               <br><br>
               You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in
               identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as 
               characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are 
               Number_hits, temp99, and _name.
            </p>
            <h1>
              
            </p>
            <h1 id="dec">Declaring variables</h1>
            <p>
              You can declare a variable in three ways:
              <br><br>
              With the keyword var. For example,
              <div class="box">
                var x = 42.
              </div>
            </p>
            <p>
              This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
              <br><br>
              By simply assigning it a value. For example,
              <div class="box">
                x = 42.
              </div>
              This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict
               JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
               <br><br>
               With the keyword let. For example,
               <div class="box">
                let y = 13.
               </div>
                This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local
                 variable. See Variable scope below
            </p>
            <h1 id="scope">
              Variable scope
            </h1>
            <p>
              When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is 
              called a global variable, because it is available to any other 
              code in the current document. When you declare a variable within
              a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available
              only within that function.
              <br><br>
              JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement 
              scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the 
              function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For 
              example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is 
              the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not 
              the block, which in this case is an if statement
              <div class="box">
                if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5
              </div>
            </p>
            <h1 id="global">
              Global variables
            </h1>
            <p>
              Global variables are in fact properties of the global object.
               In web pages the global object is window, so you can set and 
               access global variables using the window.variable syntax.
               <br><br>
               Consequently, you can access global variables declared in 
               one window or frame from another window or frame by specifying 
               the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called 
               phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to this
               variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.
            </p>
            <h1 id="con">
              Constants
            </h1>
            <p>
              You can create a read-only, named constant with the const 
              keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as 
              for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore 
              or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore
              characters.
              <br>
              <div class="box">
                const PI = 3.14;
              </div>
            </p>
            <p>
              A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared 
              while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.
              <br>
              The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block 
              scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier 
              is assumed to represent a variable.
              <br><br>
              You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function 
              or variable in the same scope. For example:
              <br>
              <div class="box">
                // THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; 
                // THIS WILL <br>CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5;
                var g; //statements }
                </div>
            </p>
            <p>
              However, object attributes are not protected, so the following 
              statement is executed without problems.
              <div class="box">
                const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";
              </div>
            </p>
            <h1 id="data">
              Data types
            </h1>
             <p>
              The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:
             </p>
             <ul>
               <li>Six data types that are primitives:</li>
               <ul>
                 <br><li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                 <br><li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. 
                     Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not 
                     the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>
                 <br><li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
                 <br><li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                 <br><li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                 <br><li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose 
                     instances are unique and immutable.</li>
                 </ul>
                 <br><li>and Object</li><br>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Although these data types are a relatively small amount, 
                  they enable you to perform useful functions with your applications.
                  Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements
                  in the language. You can think of objects as named containers 
                  for values, and functions as procedures that your application
                  can perform.
                </p>
                <h1 id="if">
                  if...else statement
                </h1>
                <p>
                  Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition
                  is true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if 
                  the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:
                </p>
                <div class="box">
                  if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }
                </div>
                <p>
                  condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. 
                  See Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false.
                  If condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise,
                  statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement,
                  including further nested if statements.
                  <br>
                  You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple 
                  conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
                </p>
                <div class="box">
                  if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) { statement_2;
                  <br> } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else { statement_last; }
                </div>
                <p>
                  In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition
                  which evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple statements,
                  group them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In general, it's good 
                  practice to always use block statements, especially when nesting if statements:
                </p>
                <div class="box">
                  if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
                  <br> statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
                  <br> statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
                  <br> statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }
                  </div>
                  <p>
                    It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression, 
                    because the assignment can be confused with equality when glancing over the
                    code. For example, do not use the following code:
                  </p>
                  <div class="box">
                    if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }
                  </div>
                  <p>
                    If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, 
                    a common practice is to put additional parentheses around the assignment. 
                    For example: 
                  </p>
                  <div class="box">
                    if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }
                  </div>
                  <h1 id="while">
                    While statement
                  </h1>
                  <p>
                    A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified 
                    condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows: 
                  </p>
                  <div class="box">
                    while statement
                  </div>
                  <p>
                    If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops
                   executing and control passes to the statement following the loop. 
                   <br>
                   The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. 
                   If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition
                   is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and
                   control is passed to the statement following while.
                    <br><br>
                   To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group
                   those statements.
                   <br><br>
                   Example:
                   <br><br>
                   The following while loop ileterates as long as n is less than three:
                  </p>
                  <div class="box">
                    var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n &#60; 3) { n++; x += n; }
                  </div>
                  <p>
                    With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x.
                    Therefore, x and n take on the following values:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li><br>
                    <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li><br>
                    <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li><br>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    After completing the third pass, the condition 
                    n &#60; 3 is no longer true, so the loop terminates.

                  </h1>
                  <p>
                    A function definition (also called a function declaration, or 
                    function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>The name of the function</li><br>
                    <li>A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses 
                        and separated by commas.</li><br>
                    <li>The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed
                       in curly brackets, { }.</li><br>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                    For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:
                    </p>
                    <div class="box">
                      function square(number) { return number * number; }
                    </div>
                    <p>
                      The function square takes one argument, called number. The function
                      consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the 
                      function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement
                      specifies the value returned by the function.
                    </p>
                    <div class="box">
                      return number * number;
                    </div> 
                    <h1 id="ref">
